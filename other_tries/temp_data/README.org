- This command does not work:
  =level5data.render_sample(my_sample_token)=, which is in the
  =process_scheme= function.  The following error message occurs:

This may have something to do with jupyter notebooks, but for now, I
am ignoring it since I am focusing on LiDAR.  
- Another line not working:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
level5data.render_pointcloud_in_image(sample_token = sample["token"],
                                       dot_size = 1,
                                       camera_channel = 'CAM_FRONT')

and again, the same error message
