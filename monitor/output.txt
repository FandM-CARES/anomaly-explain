The human.pedestrian.adult located at [373.256, 1130.419, 0.8] is
approximately the right size.  It is somewhat close, located to the
right.

The vehicle.car located at is [353.794, 1132.355, 0.602] is
approximately the right size.  It is somewhat close, located to the
right, past the movable_object.

At least one of this sample's 69 labeled objects are
unreasonable.  Unreasonable explanations:

The human.pedestrian.adult located at [373.256, 1130.419, 0.8] is not
a reasonable size: it is too tall.  There is no commonsense supporting
this judgement.    Ignoring objects detected to the right.
